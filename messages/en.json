My experience is mainly focused on back-end development for the e-commerce sector, where I have worked on complex projects in the world of large retailers.</p><p>I have helped implement innovative solutions, such as managing registration and access via social or verification via OTP code, custom management of abandoned shopping carts to reduce lost sales, and integration with SAP OAA to improve sourcing processes and inventory management. Working in such a dynamic environment has allowed me to hone technical skills on technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker, and Redis, as well as develop strong problem solving skills.</p><p>For me, software development is more than a job: it is a passion that drives me to constantly challenge myself. I enjoy collaborating with the team, sharing ideas, and tackling challenges together, always with the goal of creating clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Adopting practices such as code review and automated testing is part of my approach to ensure quality and reliability in projects.</p><p>Currently I am delving into technologies such as the Cloud, Docker and Kubernetes, with the goal of expanding my skills</p><p>Outside work, I am a curious guy. I love billiards, movies and TV series, and I have played several sports such as: soccer, swimming, table tennis,... I now regularly attend the gym. I like animals, especially dogs, and in the past I have also cultivated a passion for music, playing the guitar.</p><p>When I am not busy writing code, I devote myself to studying and improving my skills, exploring new projects. I believe that curiosity and willingness to learn are the key to growing, both professionally and personally.</p>"
